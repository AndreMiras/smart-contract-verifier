# Smart Contract Verifier

Experimenting with smart contract verification

<https://smart-contract-verifier.vercel.app>

## Limitations

It seems like Vercel serverless functions make it difficult to dynamically download solc version and verify a contract.
While this this working in local it's not yet working with Vercel.

## Run

First, run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
